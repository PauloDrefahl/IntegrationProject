Integration Project COP1500 - Introduction to Computer Science class

This program consists of 5 main applications. 
- Quiz about our class
- Calculator
- String Operator
- Data Analyzer
- Graphic calculator for Line intercept and Quadratic Equations

In this program we used 3 libraries:
- Numpy
- Tkinter
- Mathplotlib

Attention, if you do not have Mathplot lib installed on your computer, you will not be able to use the graphic calculator application.
If you want to test it, download in https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/ or https://matplotlib.org/'

Initially, the final version of my program had 217 warnings. I could fix the biggest part but 72 warning (all about the __init__ sections) still there, and I could not fix. I apologize for that, I need to go deeper into classes to know how to fix them.

Finally, I would like to thank you for testing my program, this is my first big project in python using a graphic interface.
